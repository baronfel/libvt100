This WinForms app illustrates how to use libvt100 to implement a simple file viewer for files encoded with ANSI escape sequences.

It could be the basis for a more complete terminal app as it provides rudimentary:

- Cursor support
- Resize
- Line numbering

It does not (yet):

- Scroll
- Open arbitrary files
